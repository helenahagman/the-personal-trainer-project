<h3> Why this project</h3>
<p>I built this page for my 4th project in the Code Institute course for the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.<br> 
I wanted to build a good looking website where the functionality for online booking of Personal Trainer sessions would be possible and where both the user and the owner of the site can get the information they need. As building an online booking for Personal Trainer Sessions will be one of my projects for my current job as well this fall I used the opportunity to talk to my boss for user stories and planning of the project. Key points that would be crutial for the real site has been a part of this project.<br></p>

<h3>Bugs and errors</h3>
<br>
<p>During the creating process of this game a lot of the work have been trying to fix minor bugs and errors to make the game work the way I intended it to.</p>
<p>A few fixes along the way:
<li>Display of the empty game board - tried several ways of displaying the board</li>
<li>Name of the player didn't display efter entering the name</li>
<li>No error message when player entered a number in the name feild - added isalpha in the player_name function</li>
<li>The board didn't update the player move on the board - was missing position input</li>
<li>The game didn'r restart when Y was entered - fixed in the start_game function</li>
<li>When a player chose to play again they were told to add a new name - fixed in the start_game funciton</li>
<br>
</p>
 <h3>Known unsolved bugs</h3>
<br>
<li><a href="https://extendsclass.com/python-tester.html">Python Code Checker</a><br>
<p>Used for testing the code for syntax errors - 1 Syntax error detected.</p>

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **May 11th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

---

Happy coding!
